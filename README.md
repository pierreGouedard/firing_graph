This repository host the minimal implementation of a firing_graph as well as its optimisation routine. The theoretical 
details of the algorithm can be found 

* In directory 'report'
* [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09493) 

The dependencies of the project can be found in environement.yml and the virtual env can easily be built using conda.
